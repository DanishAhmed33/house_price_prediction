Here’s a **detailed, industry-standard `README.md` file** for your **House Price Prediction** project. You can place this file in the **root of your project folder** (`house_price_proj/`) to showcase the purpose, setup, features, and usage of the project — especially useful for GitHub, portfolio, or job interviews.

# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Predict housing prices using regression and XGBoost on real-world data from Kaggle. This end-to-end project demonstrates the full machine learning lifecycle — including data cleaning, model training, evaluation, deployment via Streamlit, and optional Dockerization.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

**Objective**: Build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sale price of houses based on various features such as lot size, living area, construction year, and more.

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Real-world dataset with 80+ features
- ✅ Feature engineering and outlier removal
- ✅ Training using `XGBoost` (regression)
- ✅ Model evaluation with RMSE
- ✅ Explainability with SHAP values
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit web app
- ✅ Optional Docker support for deployment

## 📥 How to Set Up the Project

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip
- (Optional) Docker

---

### 🐍 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repo or extract the folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/projects/
   unzip house_price_proj.zip
   cd house_price_proj
````

2. **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   * On Windows PowerShell:

     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```

4. **Install required libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Train the model (if not already trained)**

   * Open and run all cells in:

     ```
     notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb
     ```
   * It will save `house_price_model.pkl` to the `model/` folder.

6. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app_streamlit/app.py
   ```

7. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## 🐳 Docker (Optional)

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t house-price-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 house-price-app
```

---

## 📈 Sample Output

* Predicted prices shown in a table
* SHAP beeswarm plot to interpret feature importance
* RMSE evaluation metric printed in the notebook

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

We use **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** as the primary metric:

```
RMSE = sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual, predicted))
```

---

## 🧠 SHAP Explainability

The notebook uses SHAP to produce a beeswarm plot that shows the most important features affecting house price predictions, helping build trust and model transparency.
